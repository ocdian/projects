# Projects
This is where I keep all the final versions of my projects. This README will be updated whenever a new project is added. 
## This repository currently includes:
* corona-tracker: this is version 1 of my Coronavirus tracker. Preview it [here](https://ocdian.github.io/corona-tracker/index.html). Its features include:
  * Global stats
  * Charts of global stats
  * Stats for each country
  * Map, which displays information about affected countries
* corona-tracker-v2-alpha: this is an alpha version of corona-tracker-v2. Preview it [here](https://ocdian.github.io/corona-tracker-v2-alpha/index.html).
	* Features:
		 - Enhanced UI
		 - Additional information
		 - More interactive
		 - Organized interfaces:
			* The dashboard: See global stats and charts
			* The tables: See paginated tables that include information about every affected country. Get more details about a specific country using the search functionality
			* The charts: Choose two countries to view a visual comparison of their history since the start of the pandemic
			* The map: A responsive map of the affected countries. Hover over a country's marker to see its stats
	* Known bugs:
		* The map took a long time to load and didn't look good on a phone. It also didn't allow vertical panning.
		* The search functionality only accepted the input if it matched the search suggestions.
		* The tables didn't allow scrolling on a phone. 
* corona-tracker-v2: this is version 2 of my Coronavirus tracker. Preview it [here](https://ocdian.github.io/corona-tracker-v2/index.html). It has the same features as corona-tracker-v2-alpha, in addition to the following fixes:
	* An improved heatmap that took less time to load, was better for demonstrating the pandemic and allowed for vertical panning.
	* A fixed search functionality that accepts the name of a country in any form (lowercase or uppercase) as long as its correct. 
	* Fixed table scrolling on small screens. 
* instaclone: an Instagram clone made with Laravel. A user can sign up, sign in, update his/her profile, post images and follow other users. This is my first back-end web project and an implementaion of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImtZ5yENzgE). 
* larticle: an example of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This project includes an articles API built with Laravel, it allows a user to see all existing articles in the database, edit/delete an existing article and add articles. This project also includes a front-end interface built with Vue.js that interacts with the API. This is an implementation of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ6PD_jBtU0).
